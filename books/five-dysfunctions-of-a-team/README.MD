3. Lack of Commitment
4. Avoidance of Accountability
5. Inattention to Reults

# 1. Absence of Trust

- Trust is the confidence amongst peer members that their intentions are good and that there is no reason to be protected or careful around the group. Teammates must be comfortable and vulnerable around one another.

- This means that they trust their teammates will not hold against any vulnerabilities or mistakes they have made in the past and used against them.

- As a result of not walking on eggshells or being tactical about your words, you can focused on the task at hand.

### Signs of lack of trust

- Waste time and energy managing behaviors
- Avoiding team meetings
- Avoid helping others
- Reluctant to take risks
- Reluctant to speak their mind
- Morale low
- Turnover high

### How to build trust

- Requires shared experiences over time
- Multiple instances of follow through and credibility
- In depth understanding of team members

### Tools to build trust

- Personal Histories exercise - 30-60 mins - going around table during meeting and answer short list of questions about themselves (# of siblings, hometown, first job, worst job, unique challenges of childhood, hobbies). Causes people to relate to one another and encourages empathy.
- Team effectiveness exercise - 60 mins - identify the single most important each of their peers bring to the team, as well as ones they must improve. Begin with the team leader.
- Personality Behavioral Profiles - 4 hrs - understand everyone's personality traits and profiles. Meyers Briggs Type Indicator is one. Provide behavioral descriptions of the way they think, speak, and act. Non-judgemental, no type is better than another. Science-based.
- 360 Degree Feedback - riskiest of these. Requires peers to bring specific feedback and criticism. Should be divorced from compensation. It should be used as a developmental tool without any repercussions. If it's tied to compensation, then there will be politics.
- Experiential Team Exercises - "Going out for beers" or "Escape Room." lowest form of building trust. Likely doesn't translate to working world. Personal Histories exercise is likely more effective.

### Role of Leader

- Most important action is to demonstrate vulnerability first. This requires a vulnerability risk losing face in front of the team so team members will do the same.
- Must be genuine, not staged. To feign vulnerability is to lose trust of the team permanently if they find out.

# 2. Fear of Conflict

- Conflict is the way people grow. Personally and professionally.
- People spend too much time and energy avoiding conflict.
- Teams that engage in productive conflict are focused only on coming up with the best solution, not who's solution it is.
- When team members try not to hurt team member's feelings and do not openly debate, they often turn to back-channel personal attacks.
- Some think they are avoiding conflict to save time, but it usually costs more time avoiding conflict than it is to take the conflict head on. Otherwise, you will re-visit the same topic again and again.

### How to encourage conflict

- First step - Acknowledge conflict is productive and most teams tend to avoid it.
- As long as teammates believe conflict is not healthy, they will avoid it.

### Tools to encourage conflict

- Miner of conflict - someone who sheds the light of day on teammates. Calls out sensitive issues and forces teammates to work through them. Stay with conflict until it is resolved.
- Real-time permission - team members need to encourage each other to continue. Remind those getting uncomfortable that what they are doing is necessary. Gives those confidence to continue. Remind them this is good for the team.

### Role of Leader

- Do not try to protect others from harm.
- Deprives participants to develop conflict management skills.
- Allow resolution to occur naturally.
- Model ideal conflict behavior.

## Random notes:

- Someone who has their laptop open in meetings is often both distracted AND distracting. This shouldn't be allowed. If their response is "well this meeting isn't always relevant to me and the discussions should be had offline," a response could be something to the effect of "I think everyone should be willing to speak up and redirect the group of we get off topic in order to keep the meeting relevant to everyone."
