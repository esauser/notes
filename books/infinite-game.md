# Infinite Game by Simon Sinek

Listened to on Audible

# Main Premise

- There are two types of games. Infinite and finite.
- Finite games have a clear start and stop, and play within certain rules. An example of a finite game is football. At the end of the 60 minutes, the football team with the most points wins, and every team must operate under the same rules.
- Infinite games have no clear start or end, and there aren't any clear rules that all businesses must abide by (basic laws non-withstanding). Business is such an infinite game. It always continues on. There is no score by which everyone is measured. There is no way to win. Therefore, business leaders need to operate by embracing an infinite mindset instead of a finite one.

### Business Goals

- Do not align your business around products. Instead align around a cause and feeling that product creates. For instance, Kodak decided they were in the camera and film business, rather than the creating memories business. As such, when mobile phones increasingly had better cameras, they went out of business, because they didn't pivot. Blockbuster decided they were in the film rental business rather than the entertainment business. Blackberry is another example. Microsoft is successfully pivoting from a "selling Operating Systems" business, to a "selling Cloud" business, because they focus on their vision of "empowering every person and organization to do more."
- Beating the competition isn't a goal.
- By focusing on beating the competition, you become reactionary instead of visionary. Always looking to see what the competitor is doing before making a move.

### Random Notes

- Leonard Wong - Lazy Leadership - using a process to control employees rather than support them
- People justify cutting corners because the bureaucracy itself is unethical or has no value. Senior leaders are often exempt from the bureaucracy and don't see the problem.
