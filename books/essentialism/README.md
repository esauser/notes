# Essentialism by Greg McKeown

Listened to on Audible

# Main Premise

- There are two types of people - an essentialist and a non-essentialist
- A non-essentialist thinks "I have to"
- An essentialist thinks "I choose to"
- An essentialist goes big on a few things, a non-essentialist tries to go big on everything and gets nothing done.

### Random Notes

- Learned Helplessness. People can learn to be helpless. If a person is repeatedly shot down or someone else takes care of something for them, they will learn to be helpless. An example in dogs: in a study, dogs were shocked and some were able to escape it by crossing over a line and others were not able to escape it even when crossing over the line. When they took the same dogs who were unable to escape, they found they were more likely to give up than their counterparts who escaped the shock. Kinda messed up but makes total sense. People's default reaction is often Quit. People who think "I'm bad at math" often give up trying to get better, thinking there is no point.
