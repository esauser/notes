# Atomic Habits by James Clear

Listened to on Audible

# Main Premise

- The most effective way to change your habits is not to focus on your goals, but who you wish to become (i.e. "I'm a healthy person," "I'm a non-smoker," "I'm a hard worker"). Don't say "I'm trying to quit smoking" because that still identifies yourself as a smoker. Instead say "I'm not a smoker."
- Focus on the small things. Getting 1% better everyday leaves you 35x better in a year.
- Spend your time improving your system and the results will speak for themselves.
- There are 4 steps for building better habits

### Building Better Habits

1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy
4. Make it satisfying

### Random Notes

- Habit stacking - pair a new habit with a current habit "After brushing my teeth, I will meditate for 15 minutes."
- Environment matters more than motivation. If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.
- "One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group."
